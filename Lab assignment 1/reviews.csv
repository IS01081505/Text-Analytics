Kevin,"February 21, 2024","As always, Anker quality shines with these cords! Very well made and I expect them to last a long time. 10 feet is a great length for charging while lounging but they are a little stiff so they can be unwieldy at times. Overall, a great product and would buy again!

Thomas Kroplinski,"February 19, 2024","As my electronic devices increasingly support ""high-speed"" charging, the importance of using a high-quality, certified cable product has become ever clearer. With a plethora of specifications such as Smart 1.0, Smart 2.0, and PD 3.0 being discussed as frequently as rice is thrown at a wedding, integrating these standards into an effective charging strategy proves to be a growing challenge. Like many, I was initially attracted to the ""cool factor"" of digital charging cables, which promised to match my device with its fastest charging capability and provide specifics through a built-in digital display. However, I advise against spending your money on these. After trying three such cables from two different manufacturers and experiencing failures within 60 days, it's evident that they are poorly engineered. This experience led me to Anker cables, which simply work and continue to do so. While they lack the fancy digital display (I now use a charger that includes this feature), they are certified to support the maximum charging speed that your device and charger can handle. Ultimately, that is what truly matters.

LoneWolf22,"March 24, 2024","I’ve said this before and I will say it again Anker is one of the best products and charges that I’ve ever used. I don’t know how many years I’ve bought their products but each time I do I know I won’t be let down my phones. My iPad actually charged so quickly, it makes so much more bearable even my iPhone charger that I bought a few years back is still working, just not USB-C.

JB,"March 10, 2024","Anker is almost a household name, they have many products with very good quality. The braid on these cables is pretty fine giving you a nice smooth outer jacket that shouldn't snag on anything and provide lots of durability. Longer cords give me flexibility when I'm charging my IPhone so I can move around a bit and not worry about straining the cord or to reach a plug that isn't next to me. I like this cord and the 240W rating. BUT, I had read elsewhere that companies were marking their connectors on these 240W and the 100W cords so that the consumer would know what type of cord they had. This cord only has the Anker name. The velcro cord keeper has only the Anker name, they could have put a label on that too so one would know. I took one star off my review for this. I'll either have to remember or will need to mark this somehow that it is rated at 240W. I have thought of returning these cables but haven't.All in all a good cable, just needs to have better markings!

Michael Griffin,"March 19, 2024","Excellent charging cables from Anker.  These live up to the Anker quality I have come to expect from them over the years.  Very fast charging speed with a Samsung ultra fast charger.  Overall I am pleased with this purchase and definitely recommend these charging cables.
